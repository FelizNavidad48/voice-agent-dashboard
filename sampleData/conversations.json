This could be related to how the device is positioned on your wrist or possibly a calibration issue. Have you tried adjusting the tightness of the band or cleaning the sensors on the back?"

The readings are still all over the place, especially during workouts. It showed my heart rate jumping from 120 to 180 and back to 110 within a 2-minute span during a steady jog."

Regarding the shrinkage, did you wash them in cold water and tumble dry on low heat as recommended? And you mentioned the color difference - that's concerning as our product photos should accurately represent the actual colors."

As for the color, I even compared it to the website photo on my laptop and phone to make sure it wasn't just my perception. It's definitely not the same shade."
